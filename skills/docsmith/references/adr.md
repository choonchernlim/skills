# ADR Profile

Audience: the writer, when recording a decision or normalizing an existing ADR.

One decision per file, named `NNNN-kebab-title.md`, four-digit sequence,
next number is the highest existing plus one. Use the repo's existing ADR
directory; default to `docs/adrs/` only when none exists. An ADR never has
a table of contents.

## Skeleton

```markdown
<!--
Purpose: Records <what this ADR decides> in one line.
Type: adr
-->

# ADR NNNN: Title

| Status | Date | Supersedes | Superseded By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accepted | YYYY-MM-DD | Clauses 2 and 4 of [ADR 0012](0012-older-decision.md) | - |

## Context and Problem Statement

The problem and the forces, in at most two paragraphs. Facts a reader can
check, not an argument.

## Considered Options

- Option A: one line.
- Option B: one line.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen: Option A, because <one sentence>.

1. **First clause.** A self-contained rule naming the concrete things it governs.
2. **Second clause.** Numbered so a later ADR can supersede one clause alone.

## Consequences

Good:

- What becomes easier, with the mechanism.

Bad:

- What becomes harder or is given up. Every decision has these.

## Superseded Clauses

- ADR 0012: clauses 2 and 4 fall; clauses 1 and 3 stand.
```

## Rules

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Status | `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Rejected`, `Deprecated`, or `Superseded`. When superseded, fill Superseded By. |
| Sections | Context and Problem Statement, Considered Options, Decision Outcome, Consequences. Superseded Clauses only when it supersedes something. |
| Considered Options | Two to five, one line each. The rejected ones say why they lost inside Decision Outcome. |
| Decision Outcome | Numbered clauses. Each cites concrete names in backticks and reads as a rule. |
| Consequences | Both Good and Bad, always. An ADR without Bad is incomplete. |
| Length | Under 80 lines. A longer decision is two decisions. |

## What May Change in an Accepted ADR

The decision is immutable. To change it, write a new ADR whose status table
names what it supersedes, scoped to exact clauses when part of the old
decision stands.

A format-only pass may bring an old ADR to this skeleton: header comment,
heading names and case, the status table, and removal of a table of
contents. The pass never adds, removes, or rewords a sentence inside
Context, Decision, or Consequences. Content under a heading the skeleton
lacks (for example "Rationale") moves under the nearest skeleton heading,
unchanged. The diff must show moved and reformatted lines only.

The lint follows the same rule. An ADR is settled once its status is
`Accepted`, `Rejected`, `Deprecated`, or `Superseded`.

- A settled ADR reports only the codes a format-only pass can fix:
  `HDR`, `TTL`, `HCASE`, `EMPTY`, `TOC`, `FENCE`, and `LINK`.
- A `Proposed` ADR, or one with no status, is checked against every rule.
- A settled ADR owns any fact it shares, so `DUP` lands on the editable file.
